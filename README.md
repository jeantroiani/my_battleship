Each played has 2 boards of 10 by 10, in one he has to place 5 ships.The other board is to keep track of the shoots done and their result. Each player takes turns, and guess where the ships are in the opponent board. Once the player makes a  guess, the opponent has to say if he failed or hit something. The opponent has to announce what he hit.
They have one shot per turn. The first player to sink all five boats wins the game.
